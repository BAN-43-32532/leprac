Most of this was done by Oscar, credit to RosePenguin100 for finding the tasouken/prime minister phase warps included in the seperate .txt.



This is a practise tool for EMS and RMI that works by using Cheat Engine to alter the games memory. I did all this stuff with Cheat Engine 7.5, ver 1.21a of RMI and ver 1,20a of EMS and i don't know if different versions will cause problems. Before you can do anything, you will need to download Cheat Engine (ver 7.5) if you don't have it, and then attach CE to RMI or EMS. You do this by opening up both rmi/ems and CE, then in CE, click that icon in the top left with the computer screen with a magnifying glass in front of it and select your game.

There are two cheat engine presets included; FC and F8. For technical reasons i dont really understand, whenever the game starts it will randomly choose to allocate memory to either FC or F8.  So what you can do is just start the game and run FC, if it works then good and if it doesn't then close FC and open F8 instead. You will know that its working properly when after attaching CE to rmi/ems, the adress for framewarp will say P-> some number instead of just P-> ????????. It doesn't matter that the others still display ????????, they will work when you go play a stage. If you want to play fullscreen then you will need to alt+tab out of the game every time you attach CE to the game.


So how do you use this then? For warping to any stage section or boss pattern, we will need to interact with the 'Framewarp' and 'Pattern number' addresses. You can right click any address at the lower part of the CE window and click the 'set hotkeys' option to start setting up hotkeys. Hotkeys let you change the values of the addresses to a set value whenever you press the key the hotkey is assigned to, so in order to create efficient in-game warps we will create hotkeys for framewarp and pattern number:

Lets say for example that we want to practise RMI Iyozane's final spell in stage 3. First look up the framewarp value that warps you directly to the boss from the table down below (its listed in both the stage and boss lists). The stage 3 midboss framewarp in rmi is 3399 and the boss warp is 6599. Since this is the final spell of the stage, if you want the slowdown effect after depleting the hp of the spell we will want to choose the boss warp value, so 6599 (its ok to use either midboss or boss value for any pattern if you dont care about the slowdown for finals). Right click framewarp in cheat engine, click the 'Set/change hotkeys' icon and then click create hotkey. Enter whatever key you want to use as the hotkey, and then click that dropdown menu that initially says 'Toggle freeze' and select 'Set value to:'. Type the value of the framewarp in the textbox below the dropdown menu, in this example we would type 6599.

Pressing this hotkey ingame would warp us to the boss, but the pattern would be the midnon instead of the final spell. Next we need to setup a hotkey for the 'Pattern number' adress. From the table below, we see that Iyozane spell 5 has a value of 9, so setup a hotkey for pattern number just like with framewarp and set the value to 9, it works if you select the same key you used for the framewarp hotkey.

Now when you go in game, go to practise mode and select stage 3. Once in the stage, press the key you assigned to the hotkeys and Iyozane should come in and use the final spell. 

For stage section warps, you only need to set a hotkey for framewarp. I divided each stage into 'chapters' and made a list of these chapters and the frame the first enemies of the chapter spawn in, but you can set it to any frame you want. You can set the warp say 100 or 200 frames earlier than the time the enemies spawn if you need to like setup a hud align or something, but in some cases this might spawn earlier enemies.



There are other adresses you can use to make things more convenient/simulate run conditions more accurately. Heres a list of all the adresses i found that you can use or view to track what is happening:


	Boss HP:

This value displays the current amount of hp a boss pattern has. You can change it, and setting it to 0 will instakill the pattern. You can set it to 0 before the pattern has started.


	Framewarp:

Whenever you start a stage, the game starts counting how much time you've spent in that stage. It uses this value to spawn both enemies and bosses, and this timer freezes for the duration of midboss and boss battles. This adress displays the current stage progress frame (idk what a proper term would be), change it to warp to your desired stage section or the boss. Warping to either the midboss or boss spawn frame will cause the first pattern of the midboss (if there is one) or boss of the stage to appear, assuming you havent touched the pattern number value. 

Setting the value to the midboss framewarp will have the following effects:
The last spell of the stage will not have the slowdown effect it is supposed to have, and the stage portion will continue afterwards even if you just fought the end of stage boss.

Setting the value to the end boss framewarp will have the following effects:
The last spell of the midboss or boss will have the slowdown when you kill it, and the stage will end after doing so.



	Pattern number:

This value determines what pattern the boss will use. The first pattern of the stage will have a value of 0, the second will have 1, third 2 etc. You can change this during a pattern, and doing so will cause the boss to stop whatever it's currently doing and try to start doing the pattern you're telling it to do. However, boss hp, timer, and position on screen will not change and might not be what they should be, so if youre using multiple hotkeys make sure that pattern number does not get applied after boss framewarp (its ok to have both on same hotkey).


	Pattern timer:

The timer of the current pattern. Change it to make the timer longer or shorter, or freeze it to enable timelock. Will not let you skip to a certain part of prime minister if you make it shorter, unfortunately.


	Lives, bombs, flash gauge and power:

Lives, bombs, power and flash gauge work for both games, but EMS and RMI have different flash gauge sizes.

Character 1 power is the power of the character that is first in the menu that asks you to select the active character just before the game starts, and character 2 power is the power of the second character option. So in RMI Yabusame, Yaorochi, Kuroji and Suzumi are chara 1 and Tsubakura, Sukune, Saragimaru and the other Suzumi are chara 2, either when playing as a team or solo shot. In EMS chara 2 changes your item count instead.

Flash gauge is 0-4000 in RMI, with 0 being completely empty and 4000 being flashbomb ready. Yabusame, Tsubakura, Yaorochi and Sukune get 150 gauge per grazed bullet, Kuroji gets 175, Saragimaru gets 250, and Suzumi gets 75. With Kuroji as your active character, you gain flash gauge passively at a rate of 150 per 100 frames as far as i can tell.

Flash gauge in EMS is 0-6000. Yabusame and Tsubakura get 150 gauge per grazed bullet, Kuroji gets 200, and Suzumi gets 75.



	Iframes:

This value represents your current amount of immunity frames, when you have any iframes you cannot lose lives/die, use bombs or flashbombs, or graze bullets. You can change it to add iframes, or freeze it to stop them from decreasing. Note that for some reason you can only gain additional iframes when you already have iframes, setting this value to say 200 while you have '0' (its actually like 429000000~ but whatever) will do nothing. So the way to set this up is either from dying or bombing, or just using the iframes you have at the start of any stage. Start of stage iframes are weird as there are two seperate kinds(?): First are the ones you have while youre moving up automatically at the very start, and the second are the ones after you stop moving automatically. Increasing or freezing iframes that are the first kind will have you permanently moving up and you cannot move so maybe try not to use these ones. Probably easier to just freeze lives instead of using this.


	Stage:

This doesnt have much use other than letting you instantly warp to alpha stage in RMI if you change it to 8 in any stage and restart the stage. RMI Stage 0 has cursed stage 1 Sese and EMS stage 0 has cursed Jun.


	Difficulty:

Lets you change the difficulty of the game. Easy is 0, normal is 1 etc all the way to abex which is 6. You can go above 6 for potential funny results and game crashes.


	Spirits:

The spirit items in RMI. Setting spirits to intervals of 200 will not trigger a zenith, you need to collect the 200th spirit to trigger a zenith. Higher spirit values will still trigger longer zeniths, regardless of whether the sprits before the zenith were obtained with cheat engine or collected legit.


	Flower gauge:

The flower gauge in ems that multiplies score or something. 0 is completely empty, 5000 is completely full, and each petal is 1000. Can warp to Tasouken even if this is empty.




For stages 1 and ex you dont start at max power, so might as well set a hotkey to set one or both characters powers to max and set lives to 8/freeze them to make sure you dont unintentionally gameover. 

In addition to using hotkeys to change the values of addresses to a specific number, you can also set them to freeze the address, preventing it from increasing or decreasing on its own (you can still influence it with cheat engine though, and that little box under Active lets you toggle it on/off). You can also set a hotkey to increase or decrease ex. the pattern value by 1 to have two keys with which to cycle through all the possible boss pattern in the stage, just be careful not to go outside of the value range of patterns in your stage as trying to make the boss do a nonexistent pattern will crash the game.
